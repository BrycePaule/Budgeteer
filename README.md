# Budgeteer
Budgeting tool (personal use)

Budgeteer takes downloadable .csv inputs from your banking website, sorts / categorises them monthly whilst automatically flagging taxable expenses.
Then interfaced with your budgeting spreadsheet to automate and trivialise the hassle of budgeting, and tax time crunch.
